## What is Wayclip?

Wayclip is an **open-source instant replay and screen recording tool** designed for modern Linux desktops, built from the ground up for **Wayland** and **PipeWire**.  

It solves a long-standing gap: while Windows and macOS users have seamless tools for capturing replays and clips, Linux — especially Wayland — lacked a reliable and efficient solution. Wayclip changes that by combining **native performance**, **flexible workflows**, and **open-source transparency**.  


## How It Started

Wayclip began as a solo project when I realized there was no ready-to-use solution for instant replays on Linux. Four months ago, I built the first prototype: a recording engine that buffers the screen and lets you save the last few seconds with a hotkey.  

From there, the project grew into a **complete ecosystem**: a recording daemon, a CLI for automation, a GUI for everyday users, and a self-hostable backend for storage and sharing. Almost the entire stack is written in **Rust** for performance and reliability, with a small amount of frontend code built using modern web technologies.  

The guiding principle has always been simple: **build something I would want to use daily**.  


## Core Features

Wayclip is designed for both **casual users** and **power users**. Out of the box, it provides:  

- ⚡ **Instant Replay** — buffer your screen and save the last few seconds with a single hotkey.  
- 🖥️ **Wayland Native** — works seamlessly with Wayland and PipeWire.  
- ✂️ **Built-in Editor** — quickly trim and edit clips before sharing.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage (optional)** — store and share clips online, or keep them local for privacy.  
- 🔗 **Easy Sharing** — generate links instantly for bug reports, tutorials, or collaboration.  
- 🛠️ **Self-Hostable API** — run your own backend for complete control over storage and data.  


## The Ecosystem

Wayclip is not just one app — it’s a set of tools that work together:  

- **wayclip_core** — the low-level daemon and recording engine built on PipeWire + FFmpeg.  
- **wayclip_gui** *(coming soon)* — a Tauri-based desktop application (under active development, optimized for Wayland).  
- **wayclip_cli** — a command-line interface for automation, scripting, and minimal setups.  
- **wayclip_docs** — documentation powered by Fumadocs.  
- **wayclip_api** — a self-hostable backend for clip storage, management, and sharing.  
- **wayclip_dash** *(coming soon)* — a web dashboard for managing your account, billing and more.


## Pricing & Storage

Wayclip is **completely free to use** for local recordings. Cloud storage is optional and billed only if you need more space for sharing.  

- **Free** — 2GB cloud storage, unlimited local recording.  
- **Basic ($3.99)** — 50GB cloud storage.  
- **Plus ($6.99)** — 200GB cloud storage.  
- **Pro ($14.99)** — 1TB cloud storage.  

This keeps the core app open and accessible to everyone, while giving creators and teams room to scale.  


## Open Source & Community

Wayclip is **MIT-licensed** and developed in the open. You can inspect the code, contribute, or fork it for your own use cases.

We believe Linux users deserve the same polished, modern tools as any other platform — and we’re building them together.  


## Roadmap

- ✅ Core recording engine (done)  
- ✅ CLI (launching with release)  
- 🚧 GUI app (in progress, optimized for Wayland)  
- 🚧 Dashboard (coming soon)  
- 🌐 Windows support


## Why Wayclip?

Wayclip is more than just another screen recorder. It’s:  

- **Native to Linux** — built for Wayland + PipeWire, not a port or workaround.  
- **Performance-driven** — optimized with Rust for speed and low overhead.  
- **Flexible** — from hotkey replays to automation scripts and self-hosted APIs.  
- **Community-first** — fully open source, shaped by real Linux users.  

Wayclip is here to bring **instant replay to Linux**, finally — without compromises.
